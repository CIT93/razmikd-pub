# Dev_1 Plan

I think that for the dev 1 project, I will continue to work on my prior development project and expand it using CRUD. I wrote down some notes on how I want to approach it, but before I put those ideas into action, I wanted to get your thoughts on it all. First, I would like to create input(s) so the user(s) can assign a name for himself/herself. Secondly, let the user choose which side of the coin he/she would like to play. Moreover, I would like to store that information with associated dates and uuid in local storage. Also, allow the user to edit, remove, or delete the information they have entered (or something related to it). After that, you can select however many rounds you'd like to play and go through those amount of rounds to determine the winner. In my opinion, this will give me plenty of data to work with.
